# Business-Insights-in-AtliQ-Hardware
I have developed a dynamic report in Power BI showcasing 4 years of sales data for AtliQ Hardware. Here's what I achieved:
âœ… Connected Power BI with MySQL and Excel, importing ~2 million records from Codebasics.
âœ… Conducted data pre-processing in Power Query Editor for cleaning and shaping.
âœ… Utilized DAX to create measures that fetched the required values.
âœ… Leveraged data modeling techniques to establish strong relationships between data sources, enabling seamless connectivity and integrated insights.
âœ… Developed highly accessible Power BI dashboards accessible via web and mobile apps.
âœ… Identified top 5 customers and products, and calculated the average profit for each year, while tracking revenue trends.
âœ… Achieved 95% efficiency in data-driven decision-making and encouraged cross-functional collaboration.

With this report, AtliQ Hardware can make informed decisions, foster collaboration, and gain valuable insights. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
